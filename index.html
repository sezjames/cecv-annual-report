and on budget.</p>

<p>We have also been making steady progress on the
rollout of ICON – our Integrated Catholic Online
Network. ICON will provide a seamless digital link
among all Catholic educational institutions in Victoria –
our 492 schools and four diocesan Catholic Education
Offices. It will allow us to pool learning resources in
unprecedented ways that will foster improved student
achievement. ICON will also help to streamline the
administrative burden on our schools by providing
system-wide solutions to compliance requirements.
Eight schools have already joined ICON, with more to
follow over the coming months.</p>

<p>But school buildings and computer networking, while
essential, are only a means to an end. And 2016 has
also been a year of innovation for Catholic Education
Melbourne on its core business – pedagogy and
student achievement.</p>

<p>We published Horizons of Hope – an Education Framework
for the Archdiocese of Melbourne. Horizons of Hope is
a pedagogical resource that will guide education in
our Catholic schools in the years to come. A ‘Google
Plus’ online community was established to facilitate
its use throughout the Archdiocese, attracting over
600 members and inspiring teachers with innovative
classroom resources and instructional ideas.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/hotspots/1/steve-elder-annual-report-2016.jpg"></p>

<p>Over 100 of our students, teachers and proud parents
participated in the 2016 CECV Languages Film Awards.
The event featured a series of student-produced twominute
films in a variety of foreign languages, including
Spanish, Italian and Indonesian. 2016 saw the creation
of 34 science partnerships that linked Catholic schools
with universities, zoos and marine research vessels,
allowing students to learn about real world science
from real world scientists.</p>

<p>This past year saw the first cohort of 50 educational
leaders embark on a two-year Master of Education
(Student Wellbeing) degree at the Australian Catholic
University. This unique program – the first of its kind
in Australia – reflects the seriousness with which the
Catholic school community takes the issue of child
safety and welfare. We also opened a joint program
with the Berry Street Institute to strengthen the
capacity of teachers and Student Wellbeing leaders in
the latest best practice.</p>

<p>We do a good job of providing high-quality education
to the children who attend our schools. But what sets
us apart are the Catholic faith values that permeate
everything we do. This past year we renewed our
Religious Education Curriculum Framework – Coming
to Know, Worship and Love. Drawing on principles
espoused by the Second Vatican Council, this new
Framework was developed in collaboration with
schools, assisting teachers to present our Catholic
faith in an engaging and uplifting manner. This is just
a small sample of the initiatives and innovations we
have introduced to Catholic Education Melbourne over
the past year. And we look forward to taking Catholic
Education Melbourne to an even higher level of
achievement over the coming year.</p>

          <p>The Student Wellbeing Unit is committed to supporting Catholic school communities to create safe, inclusive and welcoming learning environments where all young people are supported to flourish.</p>
          <p>In 2016, the work of the Student Wellbeing Unit expanded to encompass the area of Child Safety, a significant development in Victorian legislation which required schools to be compliant by 1 August 2016. Initiatives were focused on cultural change and strategies to build awareness and the capacity of Catholic school communities to meet the specific requirements of Ministerial Order No. 870, gazetted on 7 January 2016, within a framework of student care and wellbeing.</p>
          <p>Work throughout the year began with the establishment of the Child Safety Working Party in late 2015 to provide advice and direction on initiatives, policies and practices to enable Catholic school communities to lead the way in the care, wellbeing and protection of children and young people. In August 2016, a significant cross-sectoral project was realised with the development and release of a new protocol PROTECT: Identifying & Responding to All Forms of Abuse in Schools. This protocol reflects a unified commitment between the CECV, DET and ISV to protect the wellbeing and safety of all children and young people.</p>
           <p><img src="/assets/img/hotspots/9/Student-wellbeing-child-safety.jpg" alt="Student wellbeing child safety image"></p>
          <p>To complement this work, Catholic Education Melbourne and ACU launched the Graduate Certificate in Education: Safeguarding Children & Young People on 9 August 2016, a unique course, the first of its kind in Australia. It is a key professional learning initiative designed to further equip Catholic school leaders and senior staff with knowledge, skills and understanding of contemporary issues and responses to safeguarding children and young people within Catholic educational settings. </p>
          <p>Student Wellbeing initiatives in 2016 included four-day professional learning program Enable, Connect, Grow, Flourish: Four-part series delivered in partnership with Berry Street Childhood Institute; a continued partnership with the Victorian Student Representative Council (VicSRC) to strengthen student voice, statewide networks and opportunities for student leadership and learning; a commitment of almost $650,000 over 2016–2017 to extend funding to support Family–School Partnerships (FSP) clusters to continue leading local action, joint practice and governance to build stronger family and community partnerships to improve student wellbeing and learning outcomes; and the sponsoring of 50 leaders and teachers in the Archdiocese of Melbourne to complete a new, two-year Master of Education (Student Wellbeing) at Australian Catholic University (ACU).</p>

It supported collaborative partnerships between schools in the Purposeful Teaching of Mathematics (secondary schools) and Strategic Support Mathematics – Primary programs. A Number Intervention F–4 program continued, recognising the importance of the early years of schooling and the need to provide a solid foundation in arithmetical learning for future success in school. In 2016, Catholic Education Melbourne also supported 22 teachers to study for a Master of Education at Australian Catholic University.</p>

          <p>The <b>Languages Team</b> worked on a number of programs for the year, including an ongoing credentialled study in partnership with the University of Melbourne in the Graduate Certificate in Language Education – <i>Content Language Integrated Learning</i> (CLIL); the Leading Languages Professional Learning Program, which involved 60 primary school language teachers working to develop strategies for reading, writing, listening and speaking skills in their students; the Developing Autonomous Language Learners program, which aims to assist students to acquire functional classroom competency in the target language within the first semester of study; and the 2016 CECV Languages Film Awards, held on Tuesday 12 July at the Catholic Leadership Centre, where students were invited to create a two-minute long film in a language other than English based around the theme of <i>Imagine</i> and <i>Re-imagine</i>.</p>

          <p>The <b>Pathways and Transition Team</b> supported Catholic schools in their commitment to maximising every student’s ability to complete Year 12 or its equivalent. This included work to provide funding assistance for access to Vocational Education and Training (VET) programs as part of students’ senior secondary certificate [the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL)], and the management of VET Band Funding and VCAL Coordination Funding distribution to Victorian Catholic secondary schools; providing relevant information and updates to support key personnel responsible for the coordination of Pathways and Transition, including the distribution of <i>Supporting Pathways and Transition in Catholic Schools 2016</i> in booklet and electronic form to all secondary schools, and the production of the <i>CECV Pathways and Transition eBulletin</i> twice a term. The team also advocated for Victorian Catholic secondary schools on matters related to Pathways and Transition, and assisted with the coordination of input into sector, state and federal policies and initiatives.</p>

          <p>In 2016, the <b>Science Team</b> developed 34 science partnerships for archdiocesan schools, with students and teachers collaborating with scientists in universities, zoos, and marine research vessels. These partnerships enabled students to learn about science in the ‘real world’. It partnered with CADET @ Deakin University to support six Catholic primary schools to undertake a year-long science and engineering challenge to design and race fast cars. The project targeted the development of STEM skills and capabilities of ethical thinking, critical & creative thinking, and collaboration for learning, as well as the technologies for learning and Literacy, Social & Emotional Learning underpinned the inquiry.</p>

          <p>The Learning Diversity Unit works to provide quality teaching for learners of every background and ability, through a number of programs. The <B>Students with Disability</B> program aims to improve the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students, particularly in literacy and numeracy, by contributing funding to support the student’s teaching and learning program. In 2016, there were a total of 7,017 students eligible to receive funding in the Archdiocese of Melbourne. Of the 7,017 eligible students, 57.6% were primary and 42.4% were secondary students. Based on the total student population in the Archdiocese of Melbourne, 4.3% of students received funding.</p>
          <p>In 2016, 68 students were provided with equipment that was considered integral to their access and participation at school, funded under the categories of physical disability, chronic health impairment, hearing impairment and vision impairment.</p>
          <p>The <B>Gifted Think Tank</B>, a group of principals, middle leaders, teachers and Catholic Education Melbourne staff that meet together to plan and coordinate gifted education provision, continued to be a vital source of inspiration and were instrumental in developing a range of initiatives in the gifted area.</p>
          <p>The <b>Visible Learning Collaborative Impact Project</b> was expanded in 2016 with the addition of another 20 primary and five secondary schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne. This evidence-based program supports schools to embed practices that are known to have a significant impact on student outcomes. There is a strong focus on building assessment capable learners and to increase the visibility of the learning that is taking place through clear learning intentions, success criteria and the four levels of effective feedback.</p>
          <p>A number of events and professional learning activities were held throughout the year for <b>Indigenous Education</b>, including the More Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Teachers Initiative’, also known as MATSITI, which was a project established in 2011 to increase the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working as teachers in Australian schools. In 2016 the final stage of the MATSITI program saw participants joining with the Koorie Education Workers at a two-day conference where participants had an opportunity to work together on a number of areas.</p>
          <p>The annual <b>Watta Watnanda Education & Cultural Day for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Secondary Students</b> was held on Friday 22 July 2016 at the Korin Gamadji Institute at the Richmond Football Club, Punt Road, Richmond. One hundred and sixteen secondary students from the Archdiocese of Melbourne along with staff, parents, Koorie Education Workers and Aboriginal community members were given an opportunity to gather together and live the National NAIDOC theme of <i>Songlines: The living narrative of our nation</i>. The 2016 <b>Year 12 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Students Graduation dinner</b> was held on Wednesday 16 September at the Catholic Leadership Centre, East Melbourne, in which 105 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students graduated.</p>

          <p>In the area of <b>English as an Additional Language (EAL) and New Arrivals (Refugees)</b>, several programs were implemented or continued to support teacher capability in ensuring sustainable improvement in the learning outcomes of newly arrived students with EAL. These included Refugee Support Strategies, professional learning for teachers, the Tools to Enhance Assessment Literacy for Teachers of EAL project, and direct support to schools by learning consultants. </p>

          <p>In 2016, Regional Finance Officers (RFOs) continued to meet on a one-on-one basis with principals with a view to enhancing principals’ financial management skills and understanding of key financial information. A new principal induction program was introduced during the year for newly appointed school principals. Attendance at these principal induction sessions was very high. A new School Financial Dashboard report was also rolled out to schools in 2016.</p>

          <p>The <b>Emergency Management Working Party</b> (EMWP) met five times during 2016 giving all members an opportunity to share information and knowledge in regard to specific incidents and issues throughout the four Dioceses. Throughout 2016 the EMWP has continued to build strong relationships with the Department of Education and Training (DET), Emergency Management Division (EMD) and Emergency Management Victoria (EMV) in statewide planning and implementation of Emergency Management.</p>
          <p>The primary responsibility of the <b>Planning Unit</b> is the strategic provision of schooling across the Archdiocese of Melbourne. A large component of this work involves an understanding of demography and the impact of changing trends on school enrolments.</p>
          <p>After opening three new primary schools in the Archdiocese in 2015 – St Clare's Catholic Primary School, Truganina; St John the Apostle Catholic Primary School Tarneit; and St Paul the Apostle, Doreen – the Unit worked through the process of supporting the delivery of three new schools in 2018. There were no school closures in 2016.</p>
          <p>In 2016, the Planning Unit commissioned an update to the <i>Inner City School Provision Study</i> first prepared in 2014. The original study considered the increased need for provision of Catholic schools in the inner parishes of Melbourne from a study area bounded by Brunswick to the north, Richmond to the east, Balaclava and Elwood/St Kilda to the south, and Braybrook to the west. The updated study used newly released population projections to reaffirm the need for additional school provision in the Inner City and also identify new trends from the updated data.</p>
